Background

This memorandum outlines the contents of the ANSUR II Working Databases and provides a brief explanation of each variable contained in the databases. These databases and this memorandum have been reviewed and cleared for UNLIMITED PUBLIC RELEASE

The 2012 US Army Anthropometric Survey (ANSUR II) was executed by the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) from October 2010 to April 2012 and is comprised of personnel representing the total US Army force to include the US Army Active Duty, Reserves, and National Guard. In addition to the anthropometric and demographic data described below, the ANSUR II database also consists of 3D whole body, foot, and head scans of Soldier participants. These 3D data are not publicly available out of respect for the privacy of ANSUR II participants. The data from this survey are used for a wide range of equipment design, sizing, and tariffing applications within the military and has many potential commercial, industrial, and academic applications.

The ANSUR II working databases contain 93 anthropometric measurements which were directly measured, and 15 demographic/administrative variables explained below. The ANSUR II Male working database contains a total sample of 4,082 subjects. The ANSUR II Female working database contains a total sample of 1,986 subjects. The databases are reported in the associated spreadsheet files:

“ANSUR II MALE Public.csv” b. “ANSUR II FEMALE Public.csv”.


Recommendations

The ANSUR II working databases are a representative sample of the US Army at the time of
data collection and may or may not be representative of other populations of interest, to include
later instances of the US Army. Other US military services maintain anthropometric databases of
their service members which are distinct from the US Army’s anthropometric databases
(ANSUR II). The US Army also maintains separate anthropometric databases representing Male
and Female US Army pilots which are distinct from ANSUR II.
 
The ANSUR II working databases are presented as two separate databases – one Female, one
Male. In almost all cases, these databases should be treated and analyzed separately.
Combination of the databases will result in a sample that is not representative of any real
population and could easily lead to erroneous conclusions.
